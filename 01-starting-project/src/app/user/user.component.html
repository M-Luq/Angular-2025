          [src] is an example of "Property Binding". We are binding to the `src`
          property of the `img` DOM element.

          Why not use string interpolation like this?
          <img src="assets/users/{{selectedUser.avatar}}" ... >

          If you use string interpolation, the browser will initially try to
          request an image at the literal path "assets/users/{{selectedUser.avatar}}",
          which will result in a 404 Not Found error in the browser console.

          By using property binding, Angular evaluates the expression and sets the
          `src` property only when it has the final, correct image path. This
          avoids the unnecessary and erroneous initial request.

          ### Attribute Binding

          While property binding (`[property]`) is most common, sometimes you need to
          bind directly to an HTML *attribute*, especially for attributes that don't
          have a corresponding DOM property. A key example is ARIA attributes for
          accessibility.

          The syntax uses an `attr.` prefix: `[attr.attribute-name]="value"`.

          Example:
          Imagine a progress bar where you need to set ARIA attributes for screen readers.

          <div
            role="progressbar"
            [attr.aria-valuenow]="currentProgress"
            [attr.aria-valuemax]="100">
          </div>
        -->
        <!--
          The `imagePath` property comes from a "getter" in the component's
          TypeScript file. This keeps the logic for constructing the URL out of
          the template, making the HTML cleaner and easier to maintain.
        -->
        <img [src]="imagePath" [alt]="user.name" />
        <span>{{user.name}}</span>
    </button>
