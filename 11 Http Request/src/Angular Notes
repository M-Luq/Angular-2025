To send a request we should use httpCllient and to use this we have give in in main ts as provideHttpClient() in providers array  or
in older versions you can give in providers array of the root module.

this has funtions  like get,post etc which is observable that creates a blueprint for the actual get request and we need to subscribe to trigger this request 

they can emit one value by default

so we can give the type of data we receive from backend 

and we can give another argument as observe which has response and events 

here response will get data along with httpresponse so the data will be in body and the events will also has the httpresponse but we can see the lifecycle of the request and the response.



catchError is not like map that return data but it should return a observable so we should use throwError which is also given by rxjs
